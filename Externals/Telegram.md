# Telegram Journal
`comment: A completely DIY personal setup - @riddyrayes`
Telegram private groups provides:
- upto 2 GB of file uploading, 
- voice recording, 
- URI links that directly open specific messages, 
- voice chats that can be recorded non-locally, 
- and of course quick capture with direct upload. 

This can be implemented well to form a quick capture and dumping journal/bin to have links to.
